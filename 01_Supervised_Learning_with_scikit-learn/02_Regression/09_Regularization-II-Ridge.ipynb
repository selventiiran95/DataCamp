    "## Regularization II: Ridge\n",
    "Lasso is great for feature selection, but when building regression models, Ridge regression should be your first choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that lasso performs regularization by adding to the loss function a penalty term of the *absolute* value of each coefficient multiplied by some alpha. This is also known as ***L1*** regularization because the regularization term is the ***L1*** norm of the coefficients. This is not the only way to regularize, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "If instead you took the sum of the squared values of the coefficients multiplied by some alpha - like in Ridge regression - you would be computing the ***L2*** norm. In this exercise, you will practice fitting ridge regression models over a range of different alphas, and plot cross-validated ***R$^2$*** scores for each, using this function that we have defined for you, which plots the ***R$^2$*** score as well as standard error for each alpha:"
