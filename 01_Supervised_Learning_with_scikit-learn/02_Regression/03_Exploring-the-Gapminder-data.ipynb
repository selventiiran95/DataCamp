    "## Exploring the Gapminder data\n",
    "As always, it is important to explore your data before building models. On the right, we have constructed a heatmap showing the correlation between the different features of the Gapminder dataset, which has been pre-loaded into a DataFrame as `df` and is available for exploration in the IPython Shell. Cells that are in green show positive correlation, while cells that are in red show negative correlation. Take a moment to explore this: Which features are positively correlated with `life`, and which ones are negatively correlated? Does this match your intuition?\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, in the IPython Shell, explore the DataFrame using pandas methods such as `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.head()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you are curious, the heatmap was generated using **Seaborn's heatmap function** and the following line of code, where `df.corr()` computes the pairwise correlation between columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <div align=\"left\"> `sns.heatmap(df.corr(), square=True, cmap='RdYlGn')` </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a feel for the data, consider the statements below and select the one that is **not** true. After this, Hugo will explain the mechanics of linear regression in the next video and you will be on your way building regression models!\n",
