    "## Centering and scaling your data\n",
    "In the video, Hugo demonstrated how significantly the performance of a model can improve if the features are scaled. Note that this is not always the case: In the Congressional voting records dataset, for example, all of the features are binary. In such a situation, scaling will have minimal impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will now explore scaling for yourself on a new dataset - **White Wine Quality**! Hugo used the Red Wine Quality dataset in the video. We have used the `'quality'` feature of the wine to create a binary target variable: If `'quality'` is less than `5`, the target variable is `1`, and otherwise, it is `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DataFrame has been pre-loaded as `df`, along with the feature and target variable arrays `X` and `y`. Explore it in the IPython Shell. Notice how some features seem to have different units of measurement. `'density'`, for instance, takes values between 0.98 and 1.04, while `'total sulfur dioxide'` ranges from 9 to 440. As a result, it may be worth scaling the features here. Your job in this exercise is to scale the features and compute the mean and standard deviation of the unscaled features compared to the scaled features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions:\n",
    "* Import `scale` from `sklearn.preprocessing`.\n",
    "* Scale the features `X` using `scale()`.\n",
    "* Print the mean and standard deviation of the unscaled features `X`, and then the scaled features `X_scaled`. Use the numpy functions `np.mean()` and `np.std()` to compute the mean and standard deviations."
