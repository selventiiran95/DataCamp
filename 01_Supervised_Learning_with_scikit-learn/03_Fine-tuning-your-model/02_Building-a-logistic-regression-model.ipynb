    "## Building a logistic regression model\n",
    "Time to build your first logistic regression model! As Hugo showed in the video, scikit-learn makes it very easy to try different models, since the Train-Test-Split/Instantiate/Fit/Predict paradigm applies to all classifiers and regressors - which are known in scikit-learn as 'estimators'. You'll see this now for yourself as you train a logistic regression model on exactly the same data as in the previous exercise. Will it outperform k-NN? There's only one way to find out!\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature and target variable arrays `X` and `y` have been pre-loaded, and `train_test_split` has been imported for you from `sklearn.model_selection`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions:\n",
    "* Import:\n",
    "    * `LogisticRegression` from `sklearn.linear_model`.\n",
    "    * `confusion_matrix` and `classification_report` from `sklearn.metrics`.\n",
    "* Create training and test sets with 40% (or `0.4`) of the data used for testing. Use a random state of `42`.\n",
    "* Instantiate a `LogisticRegression` classifier called `logreg`.\n",
    "* Fit the classifier to the training data and predict the labels of the test set.\n",
    "* Compute and print the confusion matrix and classification report to see how logistic regression compares to k-NN!"
